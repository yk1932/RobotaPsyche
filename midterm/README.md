<p>For the previous project, I wanted to create a software in which the user is the feeder in a pond full of piranhas and tunas. The speed of the piranhas differed using the random selector between 1 to 4. The size of the piranhas are determined by their top speed. Faster piranhas are also bigger as they are able to eat more food. Whereas slower piranhas are smaller in size as they are not able to eat as much food as their peers. Tunas are significantly bigger and slower than the piranhas. A problem I faced was when all the organisms assembled together. Their starting point was the same, making them all assemble together.</p>

<p>For this project, I want to build on top of my previous project but I want to add and change a couple of things:</p>

<p>1. I want to implement a collide function so that each object does not stack on top of each other. </p>
<p>2. Previously, the program required the user to place the food into the ecosystem in order to get the fish moving. I want there to be food already within the system when launched and the fish go towards the food without the need for the user to give it to them. I want to keep the food giving feature though.</p>
<p>3. I'm also considering change the view perspective from the top to the side. I also want to add components like seaweed, stones, on the floor of the seabed which will be more possible from a side view. </p>
<p>4. I also want to add a more creatures - one that I particularly want to implement is a dolphin that jumps out of the water. </p>

<p>Stretching it further, if I have enough time, I also want to add birds flying on top of the water.</p>
