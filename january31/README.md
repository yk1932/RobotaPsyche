Proposal
<br><br>
As of now, I am interested in exploring the **unforeseen circumstances** brought about from the machines we program. It fascinates me how we, as humans, create culture around the simple and the complex algorithms that we code. I am specifically interested in the psychological impact these algorithms have on us when exposed to us on a daily basis. I am not yet sure of the **type** of software I will be focusing on but I intend to develop the idea as the classes progress.
