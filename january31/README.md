**Proposal
**
As of now, I am interested in exploring the **unforeseen circumstances** brought about from the machines we program. It fascinates me how we, as humans, create culture around the simple algorithms that we code. I am specifically interested in the psychological impact these algorithms have on us when exposed to us on a daily basis. I am not yet sure the type of software I will be focusing on but intend to develop the idea as the classes progress.
