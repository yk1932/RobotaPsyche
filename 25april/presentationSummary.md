# Xenobots & Robot Replication #

Throughout the course, one topic of interest that emerged was what reproduction meant to robots. As humans, a lot of our biological workings are wired to optimize our chances of survival and reproduction.  I wondered how this lack of ability to reproduce in Robots changed the discussion regarding emotions, biology, love in the robotic context. When I stumbled across professor’s message on discord about Xenobots, biologically assembled ‘robots’ that can self-replicate, this inspired me to dig deeper.

Xenobots are synthetic lifeforms that are designed by computers to perform some desired function and built by combining together different biological tissues. The skin stem cells are extracted from a frog named Xenopus laevis that lives in Africa. These cells are stimulated and sculpted in accordance with the instructions of a machine-learning algorithm. And then they are given the opportunity to reboot their multi-cellularity. Xenobots start exhibiting behaviors such as movement, self-actuation, healing, storing memory, self-replication, etc. This blend of biotechnology and AI makes us question the pre-notions of robots we often hold - a humanoid robot that is covered with synthetic materials. The use of biological material, makes these xenobots more flexible in unexpected situations due to the multi-scale competency of organic material, developed through evolution. 

The presentation questions the following questions: 

- If the synthetic material of the robot is not enough to define a robot, what exactly
makes a robot, a robot?
- How do biorobots differ from humans?
- How do xenobots change our idea of robots?
- Xenobots do not have brains yet they display a form of intelligence in their
behaviors. What exactly is intelligence and where does it come from? Is it just in the
brain?
- Could integrating biomaterials in robots make them less prone to mistakes or the
opposite? Are xenobots more capable than regular robots?
- Would you say xenobots are alive? Are they conscious?
