For our discussion, the reading we were assigned was the preface and Introduction
of Elana Gomel’s book, “Humanism: Science Fiction, Alien Encounters, and the Ethics of Posthumanism (2014)”. In the text, the author questions the ethics behind defining the “other” which includes all beings separate from us, the humans. She uses science fiction as a way to tackle these complex questions. 

In our presentation, we question how we can make Posthumanism more ethical. In order to address this question, we start by trying to define what it is to be human by alienating the Other. We challenge the definition of Humanism, which implies that all humans share the same nature, which arguably isn’t true. Next, we point out that Posthumanism doesn’t have a clear definition, so despite the fact that we have apparently entered the era of Posthumanism, we’re still not sure what it is exactly. 

To further attempt to make sense of Posthumanism, we explore how it is applied in areas such as animal ethics, science fiction, politics, and psychology. In the case of animals, we often like distinguishing ourselves by our rationality, usage of language, self-awareness, and autonomy but this isn’t sufficient to draw the line between all humans and animals as there are many humans who are not rational, self-aware, or autonomous. Within the realm of science fiction, we question whether it is possible to completely eliminate our biases in our creations of the Other. We come to the conclusion that this is not possible as all creations mirror their creators to some degree. We also mention the alienation of groups that occur within humans based on their race, nationality, appearance, social status, ability to empathize, and their neurological makings to further emphasize the challenge of following a single definition of Humanism.
