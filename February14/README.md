<b>Task:</b>
The Ecosystem Project

<b>Description:</b>
<p>For this project, I wanted to create a software in which the user is the feeder in a pond full of piranhas and tunas. </p>
<p>The speed of the piranhas differs using the random selector between 1 to 4. The size of the piranhas are determined by their top speed. Faster piranhas are also bigger as they are able to eat more food. 
Whereas slower piranhas are smaller in size as they are not able to eat as much food as their peers. Tunas are significantly bigger and slower than the piranhas. </p>

<p>A problem I faced was when all the organisms assembled together. Their starting point was the same, making them all assemble together. In order to fix this problem, 
I think I would need to implement a collide function so that each object would not stack on top of each other.</p>
